Spring is a comprehensive ecosystem that supports various applications, including web apps, microservices, and data processing tools.

The core components of Spring are:

    Spring Core
    Spring MVC
    Spring AOP

Other key Spring tools include:

    Spring Data
    Spring REST Docs
    Spring Boot
    Spring Cloud

Spring is widely used in e-commerce, banking, healthcare, and social media industries because of its scalability, security, and transaction management.

Spring Boot accelerates web app and microservice development.

Spring simplifies Java development by automating dependency management, offering built-in features, and promoting modularity.

Spring simplifies Java deployment by:

Automating configurations

Managing dependencies

Handling errors efficiently

Applications in Spring comprise components such as beans, application context, and configuration.

Beans are objects managed by Spring’s IoC container and provide functionality in a Spring application.

Application context is the central manager for beans and dependencies throughout the application’s lifecycle.

Configuration defines how components are set up using:

XML

Java annotations

Java classes

Annotations simplify configuration by marking components.

Dependencies are objects required by other objects to function properly.

Inversion of control (IoC) shifts dependency management to Spring, reducing the need for manual object creation.

Dependency Injection (DI) allows Spring to inject dependencies at runtime instead of having objects create them.

Autowiring automatically injects dependencies based on type or name without explicit configuration.

Components are managed by IoC and registered within the Spring container.

Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) separates cross-cutting concerns such as logging, security, and transaction management.

IntelliJ IDEA is a commonly used Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports various programming languages.

The community edition of IntelliJ IDEA is free and open-source.

Some of the features that make IntelliJ IDEA a popular choice are:

User-friendly interface

Code completion capability

Debugging tools

Version control integration

Refactoring tools

Built-in terminal

Plug-in support for extended functionality

Customization and accessibility

Privacy and security

The key IntelliJ IDEA features for application development include:

Productive development

Fast coding

Decompiler

Search tools

AI-powered tools

Debugging and performance

For application maintenance, IntelliJ IDEA offers:

Version control and collaboration

Database and web support

Framework support

Testing

Deployment tools

Customization and accessibility

Privacy and security

Annotations are classification labels that provide metadata to the Spring framework.

Annotations help automate common tasks such as:

Bean creation

Request handling

Dependency injection

Key Spring annotations include:

@Component: Declares a class as a Spring-managed bean.

@Controller: Defines a web controller in an MVC app.

@RestController: Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.

@Bean: Registers a method’s return as a Spring bean.

@Configuration: Defines a class for Spring configurations.

@RequestMapping: Maps HTTP requests to methods or classes.

@GetMapping: Maps HTTP GET requests to a method.

@Autowired: Injects dependencies automatically.

@Qualifier: Specifies which bean to inject when multiple exist.

@Value: Injects values from properties or environment variables.

@Scope: Sets a bean’s lifecycle and scope.

@PathVariable: Extracts values from a URI path.

@RequestParam: Retrieves query parameters from a request.

@ResponseBody: Sends a method’s return as the response body.

Annotations are classified into:

Class-level

Method-level

Field-level

Constructor and parameter-level

Maven is a powerful project management and comprehension tool used primarily for Java projects.

Maven automates the software build process by:

Managing dependencies

Compiling code

Running tests

Packaging applications

The key aspects of Maven are:

Project Object Model (POM) file

Dependencies

Repositories

Build a life cycle

Plug-ins

The pom.xml file constitutes the heart of a Maven project and contains information on:

Configuration details

Project building process

Dependencies

Build processes

Some IntelliJ features that can be used with Maven include:

Creating a Maven project

Adding dependencies

Running Maven goals

Managing plug-ins

To define a Spring Project:

Step 1: Set up the environment by installing JDK and Maven, then verify the installations.

Step 2: Create a Maven project using the command line or an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.

Step 3: Follow the structured project layout, which includes:

The src directory for source code and tests

The pom.xml file for managing dependencies

Step 4: Add the required dependencies in pom.xml to enable Spring’s core and web functionalities.

Step 5: Create a basic Spring application by defining:

A configuration class

A simple bean

A main class to initialize the Spring framework

Step 6: Compile and execute the application using Maven or an IDE.
